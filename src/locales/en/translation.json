    "faqAnswer4": "For online vendors and brands, no mandatory rules will be imposed on their selling practices, such as enforced returns or reclamations. However, for physical store vendors, one key rule will be strictly enforced: the omnichannel pricing rule. Physical store owners will be required to maintain consistent pricing across both online and offline channels. This ensures that consumers will find the same prices in physical stores as they do in online stores, promoting a seamless and fair shopping experience.",

    "faqAnswer5": "Vesko has a direct messaging feature that allows users and vendors to communicate directly, enabling consumers to address any issues or inquiries. Therefore, vendors handle their own customer service, providing personalized support and resolving customer concerns directly."
